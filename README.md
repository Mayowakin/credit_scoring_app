# Credit Scoring Machine Learning App

This project is a **machine learning-powered credit scoring application** that predicts whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on financial and personal data. The model is deployed as an **interactive Streamlit web app**, allowing users to explore predictions dynamically.

# Features
- **Data Preprocessing & Analysis:** Cleans and encodes categorical data from the `bank.csv` dataset.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Trains a classifier using `scikit-learn` (`RandomForest`, `LogisticRegression`, etc.).
- **Interactive Web App:** Users can input parameters via a **Streamlit UI** and receive a prediction.
- **Visualization:** Displays feature correlations, box plots, and distributions for better insights.
- **Deployed on Streamlit Cloud:** Accessible via a web link.

# Dataset
- The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle** and contains details about customers, their financial history, and whether they subscribed to a term deposit.
